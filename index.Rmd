# Preface {-}

<p style="text-align:right;">
*Date: `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %B %Y")`*</p>

Here are `R` scripts for the book **Longitudinal and Panel Data** by Edward W. Frees. See the [book web site](https://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/jfreesbooks/Longitudinal%20and%20Panel%20Data/Book/PDataBook.htm).

The [datasets](https://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/jfreesbooks/Longitudinal%20and%20Panel%20Data/Book/DataFiles.htm) may be downloaded from downloaded from website.

We will review these scripts in our [Panel and Copula Reading Group](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/copula-study-group/).

As a group, it may be worth our time to update and polish these scripts. They were first done in 2003 and have not received a lot of cleansing since that time. If you contribute, then this will help polish your `R` skills, as well as learn a bit about `Github`, where the scripts and this output is being hosted. For more on actuarial education on the web through `Github`, see the [Open Actuarial Textbooks](https://ewfrees.github.io/) project.
